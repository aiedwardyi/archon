## Eval Loop System (eval/)

Automated design quality optimization pipeline:
- Build app, screenshot, score via Claude Vision, rewrite prompts, repeat
- Rollback logic prevents score regression
- Current best scores: Dashboard 82/100, Game 75/100, SaaS Landing 72/100

## Phase 20.1 — Visual Reference Input (✅ Complete Mar 7, 2026)

Attach images (screenshots, mockups, inspiration) to prompts so AI agents can reference them during builds.

- ✅ Backend: /iterate accepts multipart/form-data, saves images to output/<pid>/v<ver>/references/
- ✅ Orchestrator: Passes reference_images list through pipeline context to all agents
- ✅ Planner Agent: Uses Gemini vision to describe reference images, includes in plan context
- ✅ Engineer Agent: Passes reference images as Gemini inline_data parts, matches style/layout/palette
- ✅ Design Agent: Analyzes reference images via Gemini vision before generating Imagen prompts
- ✅ Enterprise + Studio: Paperclip button, file input, thumbnail strip, FormData on send
- ✅ Chat UI: Image thumbnails rendered inline in sent messages (base64 data URLs)
- ✅ Fix: Replaced blob URLs with base64 data URLs so images survive sessionStorage round-trip
- Consumer frontend skipped (read-only, doesn't call /iterate)

## QA Visual Pass (✅ Complete Mar 8, 2026)

| 2 | Versions vs Artifacts state contradiction | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Fixed |
| 3 | "Good afternoon, Jane" hardcoded greeting | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed |
| 4 | Enterprise Profile modal: Jane Doe hardcoded | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed |
| 5 | Studio Profile modal: Jane Doe hardcoded | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed |
| 6 | Deep link /versions returns 404 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed |
| 7 | Studio Artifacts blank (no empty state) | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed |
| 8 | Enterprise Zap icon on Upgrade to Pro | 🟢 Low | ✅ Fixed |
| 9 | Studio Zap icon on Upgrade to Pro | 🟢 Low | ✅ Fixed |

Files changed: WelcomeBanner.tsx, ProfileModal.tsx, Navbar.tsx, account-modals.tsx, avatar-dropdown.tsx, project-dashboard.tsx, App.tsx, Index.tsx, ArtifactsView.tsx, artifacts/page.tsx

### Backend API QA (Codex, Mar 8, 2026)
- 14/17 tests passed
- ✅ GET /api/projects auth guard fixed (Mar 8, 2026) — all 5 optional-auth endpoints now require JWT
- 10/10 regression tests passing (backend/tests/test_auth_guard.py)
- Register 409 and credits/balance object format were false positives

### Additional QA Fixes (Mar 8, 2026)
- ✅ Removed 💬 emoji from Enterprise Pipeline "Conversation" heading (Index.tsx)
- ✅ Removed emoji from ForgotPassword.tsx (found by Codex repo-wide scan)
